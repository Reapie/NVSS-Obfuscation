## List Comprehension

Python has a lot of features to get "pythonic" solutions to problems, on its own they are quite acceptable but you can definately overdo it.

This example does exactly that, overdo list-comprehensions, use lambdas, inline everything and use horrible variable naming.

Even though this example uses python, as already said, every language has some specific features but some AVX C is not as good for demonstration purposes as python.
